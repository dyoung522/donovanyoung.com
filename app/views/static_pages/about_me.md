### Welcome to my little corner of the internet!

Hi There! My name is Donovan (he/him/his), and I'm genuinely thrilled you're here.

I'm a full-stack developer,
an aviation enthusiast,
a SCUBA diver,
a physics nerd,
a D&D nut,
a PC gamer,
a family man (three daughters, and a growing number of grandchildren),
and so, so much more.

However, all that said, I imagine you might be here for

- my *[CV/resume](/resume)*
- one of my *[blog posts](/blogs)*
- or maybe one of my *[project pages](/projects)*

Either way, I'm happy you're here.

Oh, and if you wanted to reach out to me, you'll find links to the various social sites I keep up with below.
